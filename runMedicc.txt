Running MEDICC (from Maria)

First of all, you'd need to format your input files so they are in a csv (tab delimited) with following columns:
sample_id chrom start end cn_a cn_b
input file should have header
also, you need to replace chrX with 23

then run:
python3 medicc2.py input_file.tsv output_directory  --input-type t  --summary --verbose
