Vagrant can be installed via Homebrew using the following commands:

/usr/bin/ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"

brew cask install virtualbox
brew cask install vagrant 
brew cask install vagrant-manager`


Open a terminal (Mac) and create and enter a directory to be used with your Vagrant VM.

$ mkdir vm-singularity && \
    cd vm-singularity

If you have already created and used this folder for another VM, you will need to destroy the VM and delete the Vagrantfile.

$ vagrant destroy && \
    rm Vagrantfile

Then issue the following commands to bring up the Virtual Machine. (Substitute a different value for the $VM variable if you like.)

vagrant init sylabs/singularity-ce-3.9-ubuntu-bionic64 --box-version 20211116.0.0
vagrant up

vagrant ssh

You can check the installed version of Singularity with the following:

vagrant@vagrant:~$ singularity version
3.0.3-1
