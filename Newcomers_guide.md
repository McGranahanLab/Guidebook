# Newcomers guide

Welcome to Nicholas McGranahan lab! We compliled a short guide for you to help you with the overwhelming amount of information you might face upon your arrival. We are a bioinformatics lab and therefore are working on several computational servers: UCL, CAMP (Crick institute) and GEL (Genomics England). TRACERx data for now are located at CAMP, but we are working on moving them to UCL.

Below you can find a quick guide to how to get access to the various clusters / social platforms / etc.
